## Learning About Blockhain

This repo is to learn about block chain and how it works, currently it is the barebones of a block chain.
I used it to learn about block chain and want to be able to build on top of it, this is what I learned.

- Hashing
- Linked Lists and how it related to block chain
- Difficulty of work to verify each block went through the intensive computation to be generated
- Validating the previous block with the current block, to validate the chain

Running `npm install` saves the libraries used to build out this application.
